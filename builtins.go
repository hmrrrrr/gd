// Load returns a Resource from the filesystem located at the absolute path. Unless it's already

// disk on function call, which might cause a slight delay, especially when loading large scenes.
// To avoid unnecessary delays when loading something multiple times, either store the resource
// in a variable or use preload.
//
// Note: Resource paths can be obtained by right-clicking on a resource in the FileSystem dock
// and choosing "Copy Path", or by dragging the file from the FileSystem dock into the current
// script.
//
// Important: The path must be absolute. A relative path will always return null.
//
// This function is a simplified version of [ResourceLoader(godot).Load], which can be used for
// more advanced scenarios.
//
// Note: Files have to be imported into the engine first to load them using this function. If you
// want to load Images at run-time, you may use Image.load. If you want to import audio files,
// you can use the snippet described in AudioStreamMP3.data.
//
// Note: If ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary is true, load will not
// be able to read converted files in an exported project. If you rely on run-time loading of files
// present within the PCK, set ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary to false.
